                The Law Students’ Society (LSS) of Joseph Ayo Babalola
                University is a student-led association that represents and
                promotes the interests of all Law students within the
                university. We work closely with the Faculty of Law to create an
                environment where students can excel academically, grow
                spiritually, and prepare for life in legal practice or other
                calling.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-1">
                As a faith-based institution, JABU calls its students to
                demonstrate integrity and service. The LSS reflects this calling
                by organising activities that encourage ethical leadership,
                social responsibility, and a deep respect for the rule of law.
